# Unli Rice — Working Memory

**Status:** Native iCloud source is ready for checkpoint on `CalixOscar/Unli-rice-Capture`, NOT uploaded. Root reran 620 tests, 2 skipped, 0 failures (`/tmp/unlirice-native-final-core.log`). Both signed Release archives passed; parent/helper/Capture strict signatures and matching Production configuration verified. Claude's B7 post-mortem found no blocking defect. Earlier isolated simulator UI test passed 1/0.
**Task:** Finish uploading Mac1.5(12) and Capture1.3(9) to App Store Connect/TestFlight. Founder authorized uploads and shared-container/helper access, confirmed Xcode sign-in and agreement acceptance, and said “go”. Do not submit for review, withdraw Mac's existing submission or replace its review build. B7/B7a canonical identity correction and B8 preview packaging are complete, root-reviewed and verified. Builders explicitly selected Terra medium / Luna low.
**Files touched:** Native core binding/provider/discovery/transport/preferences/overview and causal projection; Mac lifecycle/settings/privacy; Capture sync/settings; nested MCP packaging/context diagnostics; tests; project.yml, three app Info/entitlement pairs; preview script and prompt hook source; README/PRIVACY/APP_STORE_SUBMISSION/reviewer docs; native intent/spec/plan/dialogue; concise PROJECT_NOTES entry and this memory. Source baseline before this checkpoint was `2f3506c`. See final verification in `docs/PLAN-native-icloud-sync.md`.
**Next step:** Restore visible Xcode Organizer access, use GUI automatic/cloud-managed distribution signing and upload final archives `/tmp/unlirice-native-final-archives/UnliRice.xcarchive` and `UnliRiceCapture.xcarchive`. Verify live ASC trains before upload (last checked Mac1.5 max11 Waiting for Review, Capture1.3 max8), then processing/acceptance of12/9. Native UI currently reports cgWindowNotFound; asynchronous question asks founder to leave Mac unlocked with Xcode visible. CLI export still says No Accounts/missing distribution keys despite working GUI account and development provisioning. Do not ask for account sign-in or agreement acceptance again. No upload has happened.
**Gotchas:** ubiquity tokens differ per executable. B7 local v2 stores canonical container/environment/user record plus per-executable tokens; known token changes pause without relearning, unknown matching client enrolls, v1 original-token migration preserves UUID/cursor namespace. Corruption/env mismatch/replacement fail closed; no rebind/reset. Root independently reran signed Development AND Production main↔helper canonical probes, both directions true; raw identity stayed in memory, no cloud document/note operations. Shared container `iCloud.com.calmdownoscar.unlirice`, team22SNGN5JYD. Runtime and entitlement environment share one build setting Debug Development/Release Production. Public MCP symlink self-execs actual path before Bundle.main; signed identity verified. Widgets do not sync. Nonempty UNLIRICE_DATA_PATH blocks live resolution; fixtures inject fakes. No actual corpus opted in. OLD archives under `/tmp/unlirice-native-signed-release` are pre-B7; never upload those. Two same-named Xcode projects may be open; use this feature checkout. Installed prompt hook/client configs have NOT been updated; physical voice/interruption/two-device/iPad/full accessibility remain unverified. Public privacy/listing URLs unchanged. PROJECT_NOTES is preexisting oversized (~178KB); do not restructure. Note-contract plan unrelated/unbuilt. Correct Wiki hub ID906F31FC-0494-4CA5-9121-B0694EA047F2; append short plan pointer after commit.
**To-dos:** none this checkpoint; earlier physical-device acceptance item `BBC01BEE-FE38-4D53-9999-59422F498AD8` remains open. No items closed. MCP installed-store context connected; no handoff note needed without a new deferred to-do.
**Left by:** codex 2026-11-01 (native sync source and signed archives verified; upload pending Organizer)

## Earlier branch follow-ups

The previous session's handoff (not revalidated in this session) left: restart Claude sessions for bridge changes; the older shipped-guardrails post-mortem; founder decision on pushing/merging chore/plan-high-build-low and its relationship with local main; committing vault changes; first two builder-model observations; and watching the sidebar before a release. These are separate from Garden and remain deferred.

## Build and release reference

**Every bridge run is told to run the project's build/tests**, even a
one-line brief; a cheap model will try. Keep briefs explicit about what *not* to do.
**The bridge prompt says "implement all tasks" in the file it writes**, so a review
brief must say "write one file, change nothing else". The bridge now refuses a missing
`planFileName` or one outside `docs/`. **A builder's pasted test output is not evidence:** `builder-light` misnamed a case in
its pasted smoke output on 2026-10-17. Rerun it yourself. **The bridge smoke test takes about a minute** (four 2 s timeouts run to
their 10 s / 15 s cleanup deadlines), and it reads the real `~/.codex/build*.config.toml`. **Codex 0.163 reads a profile only from `~/.codex/<name>.config.toml`**;
`[profiles.*]` in `config.toml` is ignored, and `-p` works only on runtime commands
(`exec`, not `doctor`). **Build with `--scratch-path /tmp/unlirice-spm-build`.** The in-tree
`.build` fails codesign ("resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus") in
this iCloud folder; `Scripts/make-app.sh` (release) still works.
**A development-signed build cannot open the App Store build's app group container**,
so the `dist/` app shows "The House Rules state file is unavailable" and cannot see the
real vault, and the `unlirice` MCP reads the App Store copy's data, not the build under
test. To test UI that writes, run the unsigned debug binary against a throwaway vault:
`UNLIRICE_DATA_PATH=<scratch>/events.jsonl /tmp/unlirice-spm-build/debug/UnliRiceApp`.
The House Rules gallery is the sidebar row "What your AI should always do". The editable
draft is Setup › AI Tools → House Rules → Edit (`ConnectView.swift`); the gallery preview is read-only.
Built-in presets cannot be edited, so edits live in `draftText`, never in
`customPresets`. The app is sandboxed: `Process`/`NSTask` is unavailable, so git
state is read by parsing `HEAD`, `refs/`, `packed-refs` and `worktrees/`
directly, and every "fix" the UI offers is copied text, never an action. Do
NOT pass `.skipsHiddenFiles` to an enumerator under `.git` — it is itself
hidden and yields nothing. Security-scoped bookmarks are bound to the signing
identity, so re-signing invalidates every folder grant. **Adding a file under
`Sources/` requires `xcodegen generate`** — `swift test` globs sources and
passes while Xcode fails; `.xcodeproj` is gitignored so the regeneration is
local-only and never arrives via `git pull`. **App Store Connect can be ahead
of `project.yml`:** before this session's bump, ASC's TestFlight already had
Capture build **5** validated (uploaded 2026-08-13) while `project.yml` still
said `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION "4"` for both targets — something incremented
and uploaded a Capture build without committing the number back. Check ASC's
actual last-uploaded build per target before ever setting
`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`; don't trust `project.yml` alone. `/Applications/Unli
Rice.app` is the **App Store install** (`_MASReceipt`, was v1.1) — the shipped
product, not a stale build; `dist/` is the local one. The eight Xcode schemes
are distinct targets from `project.yml`, not duplicate apps. `deleteCapture`
purges `events.jsonl` via `TrashService`, so "no destructive delete" is true of
the Mac's note tools but **not** of the phone. `Sources/UnliRiceCapture/
Resources/Assets 2.xcassets` is still a stray duplicate, left for the founder
to delete. **This file's Next step went stale and cost real time:** it still
said "commit the `project.yml` bump" after `92be76e` had committed it, and a
session was spent re-deriving that. Check `git log -10` before acting on
anything here. macOS screenshot filenames contain a narrow no-break space
(U+202F) before `AM`/`PM`, so a normal space in a shell path silently fails as
"No such file" — glob them (`*10.32.22*`) rather than typing the name. Plans dated before
2026-10-16 say "the swarm builds it": read that as the planner's builder models.
The `builder` subagents load only when Claude Code starts in the repo root.

## Open hypotheses

<!-- Live guesses about a current problem, and what would confirm or kill each one.
     Delete an entry the moment it is settled — the answer belongs in
     PROJECT_NOTES.md's Decisions Log, not here. -->

- Sidebar pane-switching lag ("click it four times"): hypothesized cause is the
  three blurred `GeometryReader` circles re-rendering on every `@Published`
  write from `closeAllPanes()`. The fix for exactly that is now **applied**
  (`51ffb83`, `BackgroundBlobs` + `.drawingGroup()`), so the hypothesis is
  testable but **still untested** — nobody has watched the running app. Confirms
  if single clicks now land reliably; kills if the lag persists, which points at
  the 17 `@Published` writes themselves rather than the cost of each redraw.
  Delete this entry once someone has actually clicked the sidebar.

## Active constraints

<!-- Things that would change today's design decisions and are not obvious from
     the code. Not project background — that is PROJECT_NOTES.md. -->

- **Locked architecture decisions are not up for revisiting** without an explicit founder
  decision: the append-only JSON-Lines event log is the source of truth, `Note` is a rebuilt
  projection, there is no destructive delete (only reversible `archive_note`), and
  structural changes are propose-only — the janitor may tag and flag but never apply. See
  `PROJECT_NOTES.md` § "Locked-in architecture decisions".
- The app is shipped on the Mac App Store, so anything on this branch is a submission
  candidate and the pre-launch gate (`_AI Context/07_Prelaunch_Post_Mortem.md`) applies
  before it goes out.
- **The public guide and the app's own copy are now expected to agree.** The guide at
  `calmdownoscar.com/unlirice/user_guide.html` was audited against the code, so a string
  changed in the app without changing the guide re-opens the divergence that
  `docs/PLAN-copy-that-overstates.md` exists to close. Changing either means checking the
  other.
- **The Mirror folder is bidirectional, in one narrow way.** Exported files are
  regenerated copies and edits to them are lost, but `Notes for Unli Rice/` is a drop box
  that `RoutineDriver` ingests on every tick (`RoutineDriver.swift:164`). "The folder is
  read-only" is wrong; "a tool can add a note but not edit one" is right.
- **The widget build (B1–B6) had no swarm and no Codex review of the code**, by founder
  instruction on 2026-09-25 ("just build it"). The plan itself was pre-mortemed; the
  implementation was checked only by its author's tests and builds.
- `docs/PLAN-note-contract.md` is a settled stage-2 plan that has not been built yet.
- `docs/IOS_CAPTURE_RELEASE.md` §1.6 ("Decide iPad, deliberately") is **resolved**:
  keep `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1,2"`. The doc itself still poses it as an open
  question with a "drop to 1" recommendation — that text is now stale and should be
  updated to match, but hasn't been edited yet.
- The AI-todo feature (`docs/PLAN-ai-todo-actions.md`) is built and independently
  verified, but it still went to the swarm without a Codex pre-mortem. Verification
  caught no bugs, but it did not re-litigate the design calls in the plan's §5 — those
  are still unreviewed judgement, not settled fact, even though the code behind them
  works. The hook's Python fold of `events.jsonl` duplicates `Projector.swift` in a
  second language; the agreement test (`StudioTodoTests.swift`) is real and passes, but
  it will not catch a *new* `EventKind` added later without someone remembering to
  extend `KNOWN_EVENT_KINDS` in the Python file too.
