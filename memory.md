<!-- MEMORY CONTRACT — this file, not the vault, is what binds you.
     memory.md holds CURRENT WORKING STATE ONLY, capped at 32,000 characters
     (~8,000 tokens) and enforced by Scripts/lint-memory.sh in pre-commit.

     * The seven fields below are atomic: Status, Task, Files touched, Next step,
       Gotchas, To-dos, Left by — in that order, no repeats, **Left by:** carries a
       YYYY-MM-DD date. They describe ONE moment in time. Update all seven or none;
       changing one in isolation produces a file that contradicts itself in
       adjacent lines, which reads as current and is worse than a stale file.
     * **To-dos:** at every checkpoint, file what you deferred and close what you
       finished in the Unli Rice to-do list (notes tagged `todo`), then record it in
       that field: "filed 2 (...); closed 1 (...)" or "none this checkpoint". The
       procedure is in AGENTS.md § "At every handoff".
     * No dated headings. Nothing here is a log. Finished work moves to
       PROJECT_NOTES.md; design detail goes to docs/ and is referenced by path.
     * A claim carries its own evidence or is marked unverified:
       "296 tests, zero failures (verified: swift test 2026-09-02)" or "(unverified)".
     * Checkpoint as you go. Commit and update these fields at every
       meaningfully-complete sub-step, not at the end of the session — a
       usage-limit cutoff ends a session with no warning.
     * If this file and the repo disagree, the repo wins. Check against
       `git log -10` and `git status` before building on anything here.
     * Using the `unlirice` MCP tools rather than reading about them? Read
       AGENTS.md as well — title discipline, tagging, flag-vs-resolve.

# Unli Rice — Working Memory

**Status:** Product-craft guidance added to the Codebase Memory preset; changes are ready for a local checkpoint. Verified: 10 HouseRulesTests passed with `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/unlirice-craft-build --filter HouseRulesTests` on 2026-10-03. Installed app and live vault notes were not updated.
**Task:** Encode the supplied product-craft principles and align the public portfolio with Peter’s enterprise HR perspective and independent app studio.
**Files touched:** `Sources/UnliRiceCore/HouseRulesPreset.swift`, `memory.md`. Website and canonical vault edits are checkpointed separately in their own repositories.
**Next step:** Peter reviews the local website preview before requesting publication; these commits stay local.

The website has an app-led visual workbench and a collapsed technical node tree. Browser rendering remains unverified. This session does not alter or verify the previous App Store submission state; consult the release history before taking any release action.
**Gotchas:** The default `.build` failed codesigning due to resource metadata; a clean temporary scratch build passed. Preset instructions guide agents and do not mechanically enforce quality. Existing `.build 3` is unrelated and excluded.
**To-dos:** Unli Rice not connected; would have filed: visually verify the revised portfolio before publishing. No live to-do items were filed or closed this checkpoint.
**Left by:** codex 2026-10-03

## Open hypotheses

<!-- Live guesses about a current problem, and what would confirm or kill each one.
     Delete an entry the moment it is settled — the answer belongs in
     PROJECT_NOTES.md's Decisions Log, not here. -->

- Sidebar pane-switching lag ("click it four times"): hypothesized cause is the
  three blurred `GeometryReader` circles re-rendering on every `@Published`
  write from `closeAllPanes()`. The fix for exactly that is now **applied**
  (`51ffb83`, `BackgroundBlobs` + `.drawingGroup()`), so the hypothesis is
  testable but **still untested** — nobody has watched the running app. Confirms
  if single clicks now land reliably; kills if the lag persists, which points at
  the 17 `@Published` writes themselves rather than the cost of each redraw.
  Delete this entry once someone has actually clicked the sidebar.
- **The app may disagree with itself about where the Unli Rice folder is.**
  `PROJECT_NOTES.md` records `openMirrorFolderInFinder()` being pointed at
  `~/Documents/Unli Rice/` and away from "hidden `Group Containers`", while the
  Connect card displays the sandbox container path. Under the App Sandbox those
  may be the same place or two different places depending on how each resolves.
  Confirms if the Finder button opens a different folder than the path shown on
  the Connect screen; kills if they land in the same directory. One launch
  settles it. If they differ it is a real bug, not a copy problem.

## Active constraints

<!-- Things that would change today's design decisions and are not obvious from
     the code. Not project background — that is PROJECT_NOTES.md. -->

- **Locked architecture decisions are not up for revisiting** without an explicit founder
  decision: the append-only JSON-Lines event log is the source of truth, `Note` is a rebuilt
  projection, there is no destructive delete (only reversible `archive_note`), and
  structural changes are propose-only — the janitor may tag and flag but never apply. See
  `PROJECT_NOTES.md` § "Locked-in architecture decisions".
- The app is shipped on the Mac App Store, so anything on this branch is a submission
  candidate and the pre-launch gate (`_AI Context/07_Prelaunch_Post_Mortem.md`) applies
  before it goes out.
- **The public guide and the app's own copy are now expected to agree.** The guide at
  `calmdownoscar.com/unlirice/user_guide.html` was audited against the code, so a string
  changed in the app without changing the guide re-opens the divergence that
  `docs/PLAN-copy-that-overstates.md` exists to close. Changing either means checking the
  other.
- **The Mirror folder is bidirectional, in one narrow way.** Exported files are
  regenerated copies and edits to them are lost, but `Notes for Unli Rice/` is a drop box
  that `RoutineDriver` ingests on every tick (`RoutineDriver.swift:164`). "The folder is
  read-only" is wrong; "a tool can add a note but not edit one" is right.
- **The widget build (B1–B6) had no swarm and no Codex review of the code**, by founder
  instruction on 2026-09-25 ("just build it"). The plan itself was pre-mortemed; the
  implementation was checked only by its author's tests and builds.
- `docs/PLAN-note-contract.md` is a settled stage-2 plan that has not been built yet.
- `docs/IOS_CAPTURE_RELEASE.md` §1.6 ("Decide iPad, deliberately") is **resolved**:
  keep `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1,2"`. The doc itself still poses it as an open
  question with a "drop to 1" recommendation — that text is now stale and should be
  updated to match, but hasn't been edited yet.
- The AI-todo feature (`docs/PLAN-ai-todo-actions.md`) is built and independently
  verified, but it still went to the swarm without a Codex pre-mortem. Verification
  caught no bugs, but it did not re-litigate the design calls in the plan's §5 — those
  are still unreviewed judgement, not settled fact, even though the code behind them
  works. The hook's Python fold of `events.jsonl` duplicates `Projector.swift` in a
  second language; the agreement test (`StudioTodoTests.swift`) is real and passes, but
  it will not catch a *new* `EventKind` added later without someone remembering to
  extend `KNOWN_EVENT_KINDS` in the Python file too.
- **`docs/PLAN-copy-that-overstates.md` also went to the swarm without a Codex
  pre-mortem**, by explicit founder instruction on 2026-09-07. Two of its three open
  questions were answered by the swarm and one was resolved in the brief; none were
  reviewed by a second tool. Same caveat as the AI-todo feature above: the code works,
  the judgement in it is unreviewed.
